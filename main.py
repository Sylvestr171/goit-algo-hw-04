def total_salary(path:str) -> tuple[int, float]:
    '''
    The function analyzes a file "salary_for_developers.txt" with developer salary amounts 
    and returns the total and average salary amount of all developers.
        - The function must take one argument - the path to a text file (path).
        - The file contains data on developers' salaries, separated by commas. Each line indicates one developer.
        - The function must analyze the file, calculate the total and average salary.
        - The result of the function is a tuple of two numbers: the total salary and the average salary.
        - The function should accurately calculate the total and average.
        - There should be handling for cases when the file is missing or corrupted.
        - The code should be clean, well-structured and understandable
